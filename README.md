The GreyAtom CVwith Deep Learning Specialization takes you over and above Data Science and upskills you in Computer Vision with a Deep Learning focus. There is a lot of hands-on learning happening through projects that are an integral part of learning. All the concept projects are part of a single repository. Each solo project and hackathon is a part of a separate repository. The repository contains the different projects done as part of the following modules.

- Intro to CV
- Foundations of Deep Learning
